These pages capture the definitions used to drive the metrics presented throughout CareCru.

To avoid excessive navigation, multiple related metrics are grouped into a related ancestor-metric within one page.

Additionally, all metrics follow a time-based naming schema to identify when the data was captured:
* **Historical ___** : indicates the data populating the metric does **not include the current day**.
* **Today's ___** : includes **only** data for the current day and updates in real-time.
* **Live ___** : metric is compilation of Historical + Today's values.

See navigation on the right to find the appropriate metric and to discover where it is in use.
