These pages capture the definitions used to drive the metrics presented throughout CareCru.

To avoid excessive navigation, multiple related metrics are grouped into a related ancestor-metric within one page.

Within Intelligence reports, the metrics are calculated overnight and therefore do not reflect changes made in the current day.
