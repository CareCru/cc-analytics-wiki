# Treatment Metrics

Treatments are procedures that are linked to a treatment plan. 

> Note: further refinements should be made to Treatments to match the discrepancies called out in `Production` due to the difference between past and future procedures.

## Treatment

Total value or count of all dental services associated to a treatment plan.

## Diagnosed Treatments Funnel
Within this funnel a treatment will belong to exactly one status; however, as part of a funnel-metric (FM), a given value implies it came from the funnel step before it and will include any funnel state subsequent in the funnel.

The stages of a **Diagnosed Treatments Funnel** include:
* **FM Diagnosed** - All procedures which are associated to a treatment plan and have not been deleted
* **FM Not Rejected** - All treatment which have not been marked as rejected
* **FM Booked** - All treatments which have at some point had an appointment (regardless if it was just pending, or has been subsequently cancelled, etc)
* **FM Scheduled** - All treatments which are linked to an upcoming appointment that is still in good standing
* **FM Completed** - All treatments which have been completed
